HELLO I AM FINAL YEAR STUDENT! SO THIS IS MY PROJECT..

In this project, we focus on the topic of fake news crisis in Malaysia. Due to the fake news spreading nowadays, the real data and the fake data word content might be similar, so the difficulties to detect the fake news is higher. A supervised machine learning technique is used to solve the misleading news detection problem and to develop a system capable of extracting anomalies and identifying fake news or not, as well as textual characteristics. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework.

The following are the objectives of this project:

1)To investigate significant features for modelling in supervised machine learning technique to solve the fake news detection in social media

2)To design the framework and develop the system to be capable of extracting anomalies and identifying fake news or not using supervised machine learning and textual characteristics by applying natural language processing (NLP) to build a fake news model.

3)To validate the proposed system in term of accuracy.
